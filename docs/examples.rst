Examples
========

We provide several examples to demonstrate how you can use the
functions and components of *oemof.thermal*:
https://github.com/oemof/oemof-thermal/tree/dev/examples

Most of the examples show the usage of *oemof.thermal* together with *oemof.solph*.
However, *oemof.thermal* is a stand-alone package and you can
use the package and its calculations in any other context as well.
