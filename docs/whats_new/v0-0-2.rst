v0.0.2 (2020)
=============

API changes
-----------

* The components xy has a new API (Facade)...
* The arguments of ``compression_heatpumps_and_chillers.calc_cops()`` changed.
  ``consider_icing`` was removed. To consider icing in the calculation
  ``factor_icing`` (default value: ``None``) has to be set not None.
* concentrating solar power: The input for irradiance is now a time indexed
  series instead of a series and separate information about the date


New features
------------
* A Facade for the concentrating solar power is now available. There is an
example which shows how the facade is used.
* concentrating solar power: losses can be calculated with two methods.

* We introduced new facade classes that simplify instantiating components. These facades are now
  ready to be used: :py:obj:`SolarThermalCollector`, :py:obj:`ParabolicTroughCollector` and
  :py:obj:`StratifiedThermalStorage`.
* We have added a function that implements methods for emission allocation. It is part of a new module
  :file:`cogeneration.py`.
* The function ``compression_heatpumps_and_chillers.calc_cops()`` raises
  Errors in case of wrong argument type or size.

New components
--------------

* 

Documentation
-------------

* The documentation has been revised.
* The schematic pictures of the components have been improved
* Documentation has been extended, in particular for the new facade classes.

Known issues
------------

* 

Bug fixes
---------

* Figures and images of svg format did not render in pdfLaTeX
  (`Issue #46 <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-thermal/issues/46>`_). As a solution to the problem png
  files have been added and included in the docs.
* The title of the documentation was 'oemof heat documentation' and not 'oemof.thermal
  documentation'. Target name and title of documents, that are output within conf.py,
  have been changed for LaTeX, manual page, Texinfo and Epub.

Tests
-----

* The repository now has function tests, see oemof-thermal/tests/test_functions.py
* The new facade classes are tested with constraint tests oemof-thermal/tests/test_constraints.py
