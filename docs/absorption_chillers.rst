Absorption Chillers
===================================

Calculations for absorption chillers based on the characteristic equation method.


Motivation and possible application
___________________________________

This module was developed to provide COP calculations
based on temperatures for energy system optimizations with oemof.solph.

A time series of pre-calculated COPs can be used as input for a transformer
(an oemof.solph component) in an energy system optimization.
